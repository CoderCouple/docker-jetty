# Jetty 8 EOL branch

The `eol/jetty-8` branch can be used to build a Docker image based on Jetty 8. Please note that Jetty 8 has been declared [end-of-life](https://webtide.com/jetty-7-and-jetty-8-end-of-life/) by the Jetty maintainers and will only be updated for security fixes. This branch will be updated on a best-effort basis if and when new versions of Jetty 8 are announced, but no builds of this image will be pushed to Docker Hub.

For the currently supported versions of the `jetty` image, see the `master` branch or visit the official image page on [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/jetty/).
